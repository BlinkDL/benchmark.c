# fast.c
Benchmark CPU, DRAM, SSD, iGPU, GPU, ... with efficient code.

Current optimization target:

CPU = AMD 7700 (Zen 4)

DRAM = DDR5-6000 dual channel

SSD = 4 x PCIE5.0x4

Current result:

DRAM processing = 60.8 GB/s

SSD processing = 27.6 GB/s (buggy code from LLM, huge room for improvements)
